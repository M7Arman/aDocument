        <h2>The second article</h2>
        <p>In this project, assistant teaching is understood as involving and training pupils to assist with the teaching process at secondary school level, the underlying idea being to combine service-learning with training in pedagogy and a good way to review knowledge and to extend one's understanding by teaching a topic. The course also touches on the topics citizenship education, school democracy, motivation, mentoring, parent education, individual psychology, self-study, theory formation, classroom management and teacher exchange programs. The course currently stands at about 100 pages and is about halfway to completion; some parts of it may already be usable for creative instructors. The course includes a teachers' handbook and an instructors' guide and has a unique way of using Mediawiki technology to format course units. The course is conceived as a three-week course in a summer camp or summer school for pupils between seventh grade and eighth grade.</p>

            At Wikiversity we are committed both to conventional learning patterns and resources, and to innovation and experimentation. Wikiversity is open to reconceptualising how web education can occur and how open educational resources can be made, and we are open to new ideas about the use of the Mediawiki environment for learning and research. Check out and help develop our learning projects and how learning works on Wikiversity, see how Wikiversity can help you, and explore how to get involved and start adding content. The sandbox server project is also a centre of learning experimentation.        </p>

            Yemen (Listeni/ˈjɛmən/; Arabic: اليَمَن‎ al-Yaman), officially known as the Republic of Yemen (Arabic: الجمهورية اليمنية‎ al-Jumhūriyyah al-Yamaniyyah), is an Arab country in Southwest Asia, occupying the southwestern to southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen is the second largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km2 (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi).[5] It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east. Its capital and largest city is Sana'a. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands, the largest of these is Socotra.

            Yemen was home of the Sabaeans (biblical Sheba),[6][7][8] a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and probably also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275 AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish influenced Himyarite Kingdom.[9] Christianity arrived in the 4th century AD whereas Judaism and local Paganism was already established. Islam spread quickly in the 7th century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests.[10] Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult.[11] Several dynasties emerged from the 9th to 16th century, the Rasulid being the strongest and most prosperous. The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early 20th century. The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of Yemen Arab Republic in 1962. South Yemen remained a British protectorate until 1967. The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of Yemen in 1990.

            Yemen is a developing country.[12] Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described as a kleptocracy.[13] According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed.[14] In the absence of strong state institutions, elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance, where competing tribal, regional, religious and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced.[15] The informal political settlement was held together by a power sharing deal between three men: president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who controlled the ‘state'; major general Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who controlled the largest share of the army; and sheikh Abdullah al-Ahmar, figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players,[16] including tribal sheikhs.[17][18][19][20]
